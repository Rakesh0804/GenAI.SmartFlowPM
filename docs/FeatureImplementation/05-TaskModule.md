### Status Progression
1. **ToDo** - Initial state for new tasks
2. **InProgress** - Task is being worked on
3. **InReview** - Task completed, awaiting review
4. **Done** - Task completed and approved
5. **Blocked** - Task cannot proceed due to dependencies

### Priority Levels
- **Low** (Green) - Nice to have features
- **Medium** (Orange) - Standard priority tasks
- **High** (Red) - Important tasks requiring attention
- **Critical** (Purple) - Urgent tasks blocking progress

## Integration Points ✅

- **Notifications**: Task assignment notifications (planned)

## Task Dashboard Implementation ✅

### Backend API
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/tasks/dashboard/user/{userId}`
- **Purpose**: Provides comprehensive task statistics for dashboard widgets
- **Response Data**:
  - User information (ID, Name)
  - Total task count assigned to user
  - Completed task count (Status = Done)
  - Pending task count (all non-completed tasks)
  - List of pending tasks ordered by due date and priority

### Frontend Integration
- **Service Method**: `TaskService.getUserTaskDashboard(userId)`
- **Dashboard Component**: Updated to use optimized API call
- **Performance**: Eliminates client-side filtering of large task datasets
- **UI Display**: 
  - Statistics cards show accurate real-time counts
  - Pending tasks widget displays user-specific tasks
  - Maintains existing Tailwind CSS styling

### Technical Benefits
- **Performance**: Server-side calculation reduces data transfer
- **Accuracy**: Consistent business logic for task counting
- **Scalability**: Optimized for large datasets
