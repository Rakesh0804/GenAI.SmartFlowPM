## Summary of Changes - August 12, 2025

### HasReportee Property Implementation âœ…
- **Entity Level**: User entity already included HasReportee from multi-tenant implementation
- **DTO Level**: Added HasReportee to UserDto, CreateUserDto, UpdateUserDto, UserSummaryDto
- **API Level**: All endpoints now return/accept HasReportee in request/response objects
- **Mapping Level**: Updated AutoMapper configuration for UserSummaryDto
- **Database Level**: Column already exists from previous migration

### Multi-Tenant Architecture Benefits âœ…
- Complete data isolation per tenant
- Tenant-scoped user operations and queries
- Scalable architecture for enterprise deployments
- Organizational hierarchy support with HasReportee tracking

## Next Steps - Frontend Development Only ðŸŽ¯

1. **Next.js + TypeScript Frontend**
   - User management interface with HasReportee indicators
   - Manager-subordinate hierarchy visualization
   - Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
   - Form validation and error handling

2. **User Experience Enhancements**
   - Real-time notifications for user actions
   - Advanced search and filtering
   - Bulk operations for user management
   - Dashboard analytics for user activity

## Notes âœ… CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION
- Backend is **100% complete** with full multi-tenant support
- All User DTOs include HasReportee for organizational hierarchy
- Password validation enforces minimum 8 characters with complexity
- Email and username are unique per tenant (not globally)
- Soft delete preserves data integrity and audit trails
- JWT tokens are secure with configurable expiration
- All operations are tenant-scoped for complete data isolation

**Last Updated: August 12, 2025 - HasReportee Enhancement Complete**
