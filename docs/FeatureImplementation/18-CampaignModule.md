### Command Flow Example

```csharp
// Create Campaign with Manager Assignment
var command = new CreateCampaignCommand
{
    Name = "Q4 2025 Role Audit",
    Description = "Quarterly review of user access privileges",
    Type = CampaignType.RoleAudit,
    StartDate = DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(7),
    EndDate = DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(30),
    AssignedManagerIds = managerIds,
    TargetUserGroupIds = groupIds,
    NotifyReportees = true
};

var result = await _mediator.Send(command);
```

### Query Flow Example

```csharp
// Get Campaign Progress
var query = new GetCampaignProgressQuery 
{ 
    CampaignId = campaignId 
};

var progress = await _mediator.Send(query);
// Returns completion percentage, pending evaluations, etc.
```
